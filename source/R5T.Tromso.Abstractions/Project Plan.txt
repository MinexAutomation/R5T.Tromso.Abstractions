R5T.Tromso.Abstractions - An abstractions library for the Tromso project.

The IServiceBuilder interface type defines methods allowing actions to be added to configure:

1. IConfigurationBuilder
2. IServicesCollection
3. IServiceProvider

The IBuildableService has properties:

1. IConfigurationBuilder
2. IServicesCollection
3. IServiceProvider

Thus an IServiceBuilder can build an IBuildableService by applying all its actions to the properties of the IBuildableService.
